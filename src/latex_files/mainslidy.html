<p>The performance of rocket engines relies heavily on the flow of gases
through the nozzle. Therefore, a thorough understanding of flow and heat
transfer in rocket nozzles is essential for their design and
optimization. In this paper, we propose a methodology that utilizes
neural networks and singular value decomposition to reconstruct the
internal flow and heat transfer fields in a rocket nozzle. The
methodology involves two main steps. Firstly, we use both low and high
fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses to simulate the
flow of gases through the nozzle and predict the heat transfer.
Secondly, we decompose the data matrix generated from the CFD
simulations using singular value decomposition (SVD) and train a neural
network to learn the relationship between the dominant modes obtained
from the SVD of both fidelity simulations.The trained neural network can
then be used to reconstruct the flow and heat transfer fields from the
low fidelity solutions. The proposed methodology has been shown to
accurately predict fluid flows and, to some extent, temperature and heat
flux in the nozzle walls. The surrogate model developed using this
methodology has great potential for improving the design and
optimization of nozzle flows.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the field of rocket propulsion, accurate prediction of heat
transfer in nozzle flow plays a critical role in designing and
optimizing rocket engines <span class="citation">[@Zhang2011]</span>.
However, existing methods for predicting heat transfer often suffer from
high computational complexity, making them impractical for engineering
design purposes. To address this challenge, we propose a flow
reconstruction <span class="citation">[@Lui2019; @Yu2019]</span>
technique that combines order reduction using Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD)<span class="citation">[@Golub2013-ag]</span> with
neural network modeling <span class="citation">[@Brunton2019-ax]</span>.
While the individual techniques are not novel, our approach offers a
combination of these methods for accurate and efficient prediction of
internal flow and thermal fields in the nozzle, leading to highly
accurate fluid flow predictions. Furthermore, the use of neural network
modeling enhances the accuracy of our approach by capturing the complex
nonlinearities of the flow. Overall, our flow reconstruction technique
has the potential to significantly improve the design and optimization
of conjugate heat transfer CFD problems, providing valuable insights
into the underlying physical phenomena while reducing computational
complexity.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Flow reconstruction <span class="citation">[@Yu2019]</span> is a
technique used to recover high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) simulations from low-fidelity ones. This can be accomplished using
neural networks and singular value decomposition (SVD). The proposed
methodology is data-driven and consists of three main steps.</p>
<p>In the first step, the data is generated. To generate a set of high
fidelity simulations, the input parameters are varied to cover a wide
range of flow conditions. To generate a set of low fidelity simulations,
the resolution is reduced, the model is simplified, or a less accurate
numerical method is used. In the second step, both sets of simulations
are reduced to a set of basis functions coefficients using SVD, which
capture the dominant modes of variation in the flow fields. This allows
for a more efficient representation of the flow field and facilitates
the use of neural networks for flow reconstruction.</p>
<p>The final step of the proposed flow reconstruction technique involves
training a neural network to map the low-fidelity reduced simulations to
their corresponding high-fidelity counterparts. During the online
training stage, the neural network takes a set of low-fidelity basis
coefficients as input and generates a set of coefficients for the
high-fidelity reduced basis as output. Once trained, the neural network
can be used for inference in the offline stage. During inference, the
low-fidelity simulation in full space is projected onto the basis
coefficients using SVD. These coefficients are then used as input to the
trained neural network to predict the corresponding high-fidelity basis
coefficients. Finally, a reverse projection operation is performed on
the predicted coefficients to recover the high-fidelity simulation in
full space. Figure provides a schematic representation of this
reconstruction approach.</p>

<p>In this work, we aim to develop a surrogate model that predicts the
2D viscous airflow, temperature, and heat flux on the inner surface of a
nozzle, using only quasi-1D simulations. For the model to be useful for
design purposes, it must also be sensitive to geometrical parameters.
Therefore, we focus on two key design variables: the thickness of the
nozzle wall (<span
class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>w</em></sub></span>) and the
shape of the nozzle wall, which is defined by the y-coordinate of a
Bezier control point (<span
class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>P</em>3<sub><em>y</em></sub></span>),
as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:nozzle_shape" reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:nozzle_shape">2</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, we use Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) <span
class="citation">[@McKay1979]</span> to sample 30 design variables in
the range provided in Table <a href="#tab:lhs" reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:lhs">1</a>, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lhs"
reference-type="ref" reference="fig:lhs">3</a>. We consider a set of
<span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> pairs of design variables
denoted as <span
class="math inline"><em>Ξ</em><sup><em>i</em></sup> = {<em>t</em><sub><em>w</em></sub>,<em>C</em><em>P</em>3<sub><em>y</em></sub>}<sup><em>i</em></sup></span>.
For each pair, we collect a low-fidelity snapshot (<span
class="math inline"><strong>L</strong><sup><em>i</em></sup> ∈ ℝ<sup><em>S</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></sup></span>)
and a high-fidelity snapshot (<span
class="math inline"><strong>H</strong><sup><em>i</em></sup> ∈ ℝ<sup><em>S</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></sup></span>)
that contain the modeled variables.</p>
<p>To store the low-fidelity and high-fidelity snapshots, we use two
matrices, denoted by <span
class="math inline"><strong>A</strong><sub><em>L</em></sub></span> and
<span
class="math inline"><strong>A</strong><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>,
respectively. The low-fidelity snapshots are stored in <span

<p>The low-fidelity model used in this study is an in-house finite
volume solver based on the quasi-1D Euler equations <span
class="citation">[@Hirsch2007-ug]</span>. These equations simplify the
full problem by neglecting viscous and heat transfer effects but account
for compressibility effects, which reduces computational costs while
still capturing the important behavior of transonic and supersonic
flows. The boundary conditions at the inlet include total pressure
(<span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>0</sub> = 800</span> kPa) and
total temperature (<span
class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub>0</sub> = 600</span> K), while the
outlet boundary condition is static pressure (<span

<p>In contrast, the high-fidelity model is a 2D Navier-Stokes solver
coupled with conjugate heat transfer to the solid nozzle walls. The
equations for the fluid domain were solved using the SU2 <span

model. Additionally, the energy equation for heat transfer in the wall
boundary was included. The outside wall temperature was fixed at a
constant temperature (<span
class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> = 300</span>), while
the inside wall temperature was calculated based on the energy balance
due to heat transfer from the hot air flow to the AISI406 steel walls.
In this case, the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>-th
snapshot takes into account the wall thickness (<span

<p>The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed methodology
in reconstructing the pressure, temperature, and Mach fields, as
evidenced by the high <span

values. The <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>
values approach 1, indicating that the reconstructed results account for
a large portion of the variance in the CFD simulation results.
Additionally, the relatively small MAE values indicate that the errors
between the reconstructed results and the CFD simulation results are
minimal.</p>

<p>The proposed methodology exhibits significant potential for
accurately reconstructing fluid flow and heat transfer fields in a
rocket nozzle. The results indicate that the methodology can accurately
reconstruct fluid flow fields, particularly the pressure field, as
demonstrated in Figures <a href="#fig:r2_pressure" reference-type="ref"

However, the surrogate model’s performance was inadequate for variables
in the solid domain, such as temperature and heat flux, as evident in
Figure <a href="#fig:r2_heat_flux" reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:r2_heat_flux">18</a>,<a

<p>Combining the neural network approach with singular value
decomposition results in an efficient and accurate method for
reconstructing flow and heat transfer fields from low fidelity
simulations. This methodology is a promising tool for designing and
optimizing rocket nozzles, where accurate predictions of the flow and
heat transfer fields are critical for ensuring optimal performance and
safety.</p>
<p>Although the model’s performance may be poor in some cases, it still
has value. This is because the low-fidelity model alone was unable to
provide a solution for the coupled heat transfer problem, and even
inaccurate predictions can guide decision-making in a design process, as
shown in Figures <a href="#fig:wall_heat_flux" reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wall_heat_flux">21</a> and <a
href="#fig:wall_temperature_solid_wall" reference-type="ref"

transfer and wall temperature are not well predicted, the overall trend
is captured.</p>

<p>Despite the inaccuracies in the solid field solutions, it is
important to emphasize the significant speedup achieved by the surrogate
model. While high-fidelity CFD took about 1 hour and 30 minutes to
complete, the surrogate model can predict a flow field within just 10.6
seconds (an astonishing 500-fold speedup). It’s important to note that
this time includes the time needed to generate the mesh for a new
geometry, as during data projection into the latent space, all spatial
information is lost.</p>

Limitations and Improvements Suggestions</h2>
<p>However, one major drawback of the model is the need for a large
amount of data for training. Since the dataset used for training is
quite small, adding more snapshots is expected to improve model
accuracy. Additionally, using more elaborate individual normalization
techniques for each variable could help the model. Another suggestion is
to perform hyperparameter optimization on the number of layers and
neurons, activation functions, and try more advanced loss functions and
optimization algorithms. Moreover, redesigning the variables selected to
compose the dataset could also help improve the model. Replacing single
scalar values of wall thickness and the y-coordinate of the control
point with a distribution of wall thickness and the distribution of
y-coordinates for the nozzle wall could help the model to predict
variability associated with the wall contour change.</p>

<h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
<p>In conclusion, although our methodology did not introduce any novel
techniques, it proved to be effective in accurately reconstructing the
fluid flow in a rocket nozzle using neural network and singular value
decomposition. However, we acknowledged that the methodology’s
performance was limited in reconstructing the heat flux and wall
temperature fields. We provided suggestions for improving the
methodology and suggested increasing the sample size in the dataset and
comparing our model with other surrogate models as future work. Despite
these limitations, the proposed methodology has the potential to enhance
the design and optimization cycle by offering a more precise
understanding of flow and heat transfer while reducing computational
cost.</p>
